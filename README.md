## Warm-Up Challenges:

### 1. Sales by Match

Alex works at a clothing store. There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color for sale. Given an array of 
integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
For example, there are ```n=7``` socks with colors ```ar=[1,2,1,2,1,3,2]```. There is one pair of color ```1``` and one of 
color ```2```. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.   

### 2. Counting Valleys

Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. 
During his last hike, he took exactly ```n``` steps. For ever step he took, he noted if it was an *uphill* or 
a *downhill* step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level. We define the following terms: 
- A *mountain* is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step ```up``` from sea level
and ending with a step ```down``` to sea level. 
- A *valley* is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step ```down``` from sea level
and ending with a step ```up``` to sea level. 

Given Gary's sequence of *up* and *down* steps during his last hike, find and print the number of *valleys* he walked through.

### 3. Jumping on the Clouds 
[Problem Statement:](https://hackerrank-challenge-pdfs.s3.amazonaws.com/20832-jumping-on-the-clouds-English?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAR6O7GJNX5DNFO3PV&Expires=1607958965&Signature=aEmnDI7Va%2FCG01xh10mIUMzyxuc%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3Djumping-on-the-clouds-English.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf)
There is a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds. Some of the clouds are thunderheads and 
others are cumulus. The player can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the number of 
the current cloud plus 1 or 2. The player must avoid the thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take
to jump from the starting position to the last cloud. It is always possible to win the game. 

For each game, you will get an array of clouds numbered 0 if they are safe or 1 if they must be avoided. 

### 4. Repeated String 
[Problem Statement:](https://hackerrank-challenge-pdfs.s3.amazonaws.com/24548-repeated-string-English?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAR6O7GJNX5DNFO3PV&Expires=1607959121&Signature=EVdXK6nfUp2XZhj%2F%2BQEw%2Btqmfsg%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3Drepeated-string-English.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf)
There is a string, ```s```, of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, ```n```, 
find and print the number of letter a's in the first ```n``` letters of the infinite string.
